# Lightning-Network-Topological-Analysis

Lightning Channel Optimizer applies network analyses for choosing which nodes to set up payment channels with. 

When a new lightning node is set up, Lightning Channel Optimizer scans the network, applies an algorithm for finding optimal nodes to connect to based on the user's needs, and sets up payment channels with them. The connectivity of the new node with its new payment channels can be visualized and its connectivity is assessed.
